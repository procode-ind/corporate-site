# This workflow automates the deployment of the site to GitHub Pages.
# It runs automatically on a push to the main branch or can be triggered manually.
# There are two jobs:
# 1. build: installs dependencies, builds the project, and uploads the build artifact.
# 2. deploy: publishes the uploaded artifact to GitHub Pages.
# The workflow includes specific permissions for contents, pages, and id-token,
# and uses concurrency to cancel any in-progress runs when a new one starts.
